# Flux Installer Guide

This project contains a small Next.js site that walks users through the manual setup for the Flux Kontext workflow. It explains which models to download, how to install custom nodes and where everything belongs. If your hardware is supported you can skip these steps entirely and use the oneâ€‘click installer provided on the site.

## Running the site locally

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000> to view the guide. Changes to files in `pages/` will hot reload.
